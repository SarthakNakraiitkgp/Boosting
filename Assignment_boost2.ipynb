    "Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) is a machine learning algorithm that belongs to the family of boosting algorithms. It is a supervised learning algorithm used for both regression and classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), a decision tree is fitted to the data in a step-wise manner, with each new tree attempting to correct the errors made by the previous tree. The prediction of the ensemble model is obtained by summing the predictions of all the individual trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"gradient\" in gradient boosting refers to the use of the gradient descent optimization algorithm to minimize the loss function (e.g., mean squared error) of the model. At each step, the gradient of the loss function with respect to the prediction is computed, and the tree is fitted to the negative gradient, which corresponds to the direction of steepest descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "GBR is a powerful algorithm that can handle a large number of features and nonlinear relationships between the features and the target variable. However, it can be prone to overfitting if the model is too complex or if the data is noisy. Therefore, it is important to tune the hyperparameters of the model (e.g., the number of trees, the learning rate, the maximum depth of the trees) to achieve the best performance on the validation set."
